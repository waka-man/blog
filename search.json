This is my foray into the world of blogging using Quarto\n\nWhy?\nWell, I guess I have a lot to say about a lot of things and I want to say them in a long form format, to whoever might be interested since Twitter isn’t no longer enough. :)\n\n\nWhat?\nI will probably, mainly write about SOFTWARE | AI | And whatever it is occupying my unpaid time at any given moment, since I tend to try a lot of things.\n\n\nHow?\nUsing this nice framework called Quarto that lets you use Yaml and Markdown to write blog posts. And for people that are scared of directly dealing with HTML/CSS and JavaScript for blogposts, while also being interested in programming, this is the best solution."

    "text": "I discovered Quarto today by accident and I have already setup and deployed a pretty neat blog site, powered by Github Pages. If you are a web developer, or even a full stack developer, this might not come as a surprise to you. And that’s probably because you don’t know what kind of a “computer person” I am. I have done my fair share of dabbling when it comes to programming, but, one area I have avoided like a plague would be front-end programming. People who are close to me might have even over-heard me say that I am unable of coming up with anything visually appealing. As a result, I have managed to not have a personal website for the entirety of my career (until now, of course), which seems to have become a cardinal sin in our profession.\nDon’t get me wrong, I can work my way around HTML when I need some basic rendering done in the browser for whatever pet project I could be working on, but I never got around to actually understand what it takes to make a basic website responsive. And with the proliferation of all sorts of frameworks (that somehow always happen to be built on top of JavaScript), getting my own website I can tinker with and customize however I wanted became something I put aside, until I discovered Quarto, today!\n\n\nBefore I get into the details of this magic I found, let me tell you about why I didn’t just sign up for a WordPress account and started blogging over there. (Or any similar type CMS for that matter?). Well, one thing you have to understand about programmers (or tech people more generally) is, we need to see what’s happening behind the scenes when we are doing something computer related (at least I am). We also need to have some sort of elevated control when it comes to the tools we use. And most of these out of the box CMS providers abstract most of the “behind the scenes” stuff to the point that it worsens our Imposter Syndrome. More than that, even when these types of systems gave you a little bit more control, you are faced with having to directly edit HTML and CSS files, which, for someone like me, has never been intuitive or fun."

Or having to hack together a workable Nginx or Apache web server on your local machine. Check out this Gallery to see some of the amazing things people have done with Quarto."

    "text": "How\nEnough with the talk and let’s get you a nice little blog site on your Github. I will walk you through all the steps I took, and the things I found out so that you can get started with Quarto with minimal friction. Now, how I stubmled upon Quarto is accidental, as I was trying to work my way around nbdev, another open source library which lets you create software libraries using Jupyter Notebooks, so that the development, documentation and testing of your software library is done with ease. As a result, I understand some of the steps I took before I got started with Quarto are not applicable here, and I will probably blog about nbdev pretty soon. P.S. I will be using VSCode as my main editor.\nHere are the steps I took to get started with Quarto:\n\nCreate an empty git repository on GitHub and clone it to your local machine. So, for instance, I created a github.com/waka-man/blog.git repository so that my blog site would become https://waka-man.github.io/blog.\nIn Visual Studio Code, install the Quarto extension. This extension comes with a lot of goodies, including the ability to get syntax highlighting for the Markdown you write.\nOpen the command palette and type quarto. You should see some quarto based commands. Click on the Quarto:Create Project command, which will take you through some steps:\n\n\nAnd then chose Blog Project. This will initialize a basic blog site, that you can immediately start working with. You will have the following directory structure after creating your Quarto blog project.\n├── blog\n│   ├── posts\n│   │   ├── sample\n│   │   ├── _metadata.yml\n│   ├── _quarto.yml\n│   ├── about.qmd\n│   ├── index.qmd\n│   ├── profile.jpg\n│   ├── style.css\n\nHere are the files you need to worry about:\n\n\n\nFile\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n_quarto.yml\nQuarto project file.\n\n\nindex.qmd\nBlog home page.\n\n\nabout.qmd\nBlog about page.\n\n\nstyle.css\nCustom CSS for website.\n\n\nprofile.jpg\nProfile picture for about page\n\n\n\nMost of the chnages you need to make happen inside the _quarto.yml file. I will show you mine and explain some of the things. It is very intuitive and easy to understand.\n\n\n_quarto.yml\n\n\nproject:\n  type: website\n\nwebsite:\n  title: \"waka-man.github.io\"\n  navbar:\n    right:\n      - about.qmd\n      - icon: github\n        href: https://github.com/waka-man\n      - icon: twitter\n        href: https://twitter.com/WakumaTekalign\n  twitter-card:\n    creator: \"@WakumaTekalign\"\n    site: https://waka-man.github.io\nformat:\n  html:\n    theme:\n      light: flatly\n      dark: darkly\n    css: styles.css\n\nexecute:\n  freeze: auto\n\nMost of the things here seem very straight forward. But, here’s a bit of an explanation as to what the yaml code above is doing:\n\nName of your blog goes to website > title\nYou control what appears on your NavBar under website > navbar\nYou don’t need this, but, if you want you can control the visuals of your twitter card (a card that appears on Twitter when you share a link from your blog) under website > twitter-card\nYou control how your page is rendered (which is HTML by default in our case) under format > html\nThat also where you define the theme you will be using. There are 20+ themes you can chose from (and since Quarto uses Bootstrap, you can use Bootstrap themes and let your creativity run wild)\nThe last part is where I am setting whether I want to freeze this blog or not, which controls the behaviour of posts that have executable code blocks. For now, you can leave this and not worry about it."

    "text": "Getting your Hands Dirty (AKA Your First Post)\nTo create your first post, all you have to do is create a folder that holds everything your blog post needs inside your posts folder. So, for instance, I would create a folder posts/my_first_blog to begin. And then, within that folder, create an posts/my_first_blog/index.qmd file, which will be your first blog post. You can use Quarto’s rendering functionality that lets you preview your post locally.\nNow, you might be asking, what is a .qmd file? It is a special type of file that is part Markdown and part Yaml. For istance, this blog I am currently writing begins with the following Yaml code and the body is Markdown:\n\n\nposts/00/index.qmd\n\n---\ntitle: \"Blogging for Backend Developers and DevOps Engineers\"\ndescription: \"Or as I would like to call us, \\\"people scared of HTML and CSS\\\"\"\nauthor: \"Waka\"\ndate: \"4/14/2023\"\nimage: image.jpg\n---\n\n# Markdown Goes Here\n\nIf this isn’t self explanatory, I don’t know what is, lol. As you can see, every .qmd file starts with a Yaml key:value pairs that configure some ways how we want that page to be displayed. For instance, my about.qmd file starts like this:\n\n\nblog/about.qmd\n\n---\ntitle: \"About Me?\"\nimage: Waka.jpg\nabout:\n  template: trestles\n  links:\n    - icon: twitter\n      text: Twitter\n      href: https://twitter.com/WakumaTekalign\n\n    - icon: github\n      text: Github\n      href: https://github.com/waka-man\n\n---\n#Markdown Goes HERE\n\nAs a starter, you can use this Dummy Quarto Post. It has all the major things you could do with Quarto.\n\nDeploy to Github Pages\nNow that you have a boilerplate blog site and your first blog post, you can host it on Github Pages. To do so, you first need to create a branch called gh-pages in your repository. Consider this branch as your main working branch (for Quarto purposes). Then, go to your github profile, and under the Setting of your repository, enable github pages for it. Make sure you have set github pages to “deploy from branch” and the root of the site is / like so:\n\nNow that you have enabled Github pages, the next step is to commit all your changes to the gh-pages branch, and push. After you push, make sure you switch to your main branch and that you are at the root (/) of your repository for this step (VERY IMPORTANT) and run the following command:\n\n\nterminal\n\nquarto publish gh-pages\n\nBelieve it or not, that’s it! You have a live blog site that you can use and publish to right from VSCode. I couldn’t believe it either, but here we are. Writing the content of this blog post has taken me more time than setting it up, and that’s exactly what power users that don’t want to deal with clunky HTML want."

And like I said, this is particularly interesting to people that have a lot of technical experience, but not when it comes to web development, and are also interested in writing. The possibilities with Quarto seem endless from my initial impression and I am sure I have found something that perfectly fits my workflow and needs. I hope someone out there, that is struggling with setting up their personal website, makes use of this amazing tool.\nP.S. This is not an Advertisement either, I genuinely love this tool so far! Have fun!"
